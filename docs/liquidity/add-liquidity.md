## How to Add Liquidity

### Step 1: Navigate to Liquidity Tab
Go to the **Liquidity** tab in the Jaine application.

### Step 2: Choose Your Pair
Select the token pair you want to provide liquidity for (e.g., $0G/$USDT).

### Step 3: Enter Amounts
- Enter the amount for both tokens
- Amounts must match the current pool ratio
- The interface will auto-balance if needed

### Step 4: Review and Confirm
- Check the pool share percentage
- Review estimated fee earnings
- Click **Add Liquidity**
- Approve the transaction in your wallet

## What You Receive

### LP Tokens

### Pool Share

## Earning Fees
