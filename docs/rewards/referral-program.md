# Referral Program

Earn rewards by introducing new users to Jaine. Our multi-tier referral program rewards both referrers and new users.

## How It Works

The referral program operates on a commission-based model where you earn a percentage of trading fees from users you refer.

### Program Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Referral Link** | Unique tracking URL for each user |
| **Commission** | Earn from referee trading fees |
| **Tier System** | Higher tiers = better rewards |
| **Payment** | Weekly automatic distribution |
| **Duration** | Lifetime of referred account |

## Commission Tiers

### Tier Requirements

| Tier | Monthly Volume (Referrals) | Commission Rate | Referee Discount |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Bronze** | < $100K | 10% | 5% |
| **Silver** | $100K - $500K | 15% | 7.5% |
| **Gold** | $500K - $2M | 20% | 10% |
| **Platinum** | $2M - $10M | 25% | 12.5% |
| **Diamond** | > $10M | 30% | 15% |

### Commission Calculation

```
Your Commission = Trading Fee × Commission Rate
Referee Discount = Trading Fee × Discount Rate

Example:
- Referee trades $10,000 (0.3% fee = $30)
- Gold Tier: You earn $6 (20% of $30)
- Referee saves $3 (10% discount)
```
